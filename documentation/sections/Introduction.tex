\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

In this document an AI is implemented and trained to play the bidimensional Snake game. The AI is a Neural Network (NN), trained with Reinforcement Learning on an ex-novo created Snake game. This is an exercise to familiarise with the reinforcement learning, inspired by many Youtube videos on this topic \cite{SNAKE1,SNAKE2,SNAKE3,SNAKE4,SNAKE5,SNAKE6}. The whole source code for the game, NN and documentation is in Reference~\cite{MyGITHUB}. \\

The Snake game is described in Section~\ref{sec:snake}. The NN is instead presented in Section~\ref{}.
